=== Codes
=========
The code is inspired by my dotfile manager project before this, it 
called DotMan. But it had too many bugs and very dependant to linux, 
meanwhile this DAN is not. But you still need bash or powershell, 
because it is created with bash and powershell.

projects:

	- GNU Stow (https://www.gnu.org/software/stow)
