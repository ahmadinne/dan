	- Apply

	- Sync all

	- Apply all

	- Remove

	- List


=== Codes
=========
The code is inspired by my dotfile manager project before this, it 
called DotMan. But it had too many bugs and very dependant to linux, 
meanwhile this DAN is not. But you still need bash, because it is 
created with bash.


=== Inspiration
===============
Dan was inspired by and made possibly by the following amazing
projects:

	- GNU Stow (https://www.gnu.org/software/stow)

	- DotMan (https://github.com/ahmadinne/dotman)

	- Tin-Can Linux (https://tincan-linux.github.io/)
